description: 'SOON nodes accept HTTP requests using the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.'

## Info
For JavaScript applications, use the SOON JavaScript SDK as a convenient interface for the RPC methods to interact with a SOON node. For a PubSub connection to a SOON node, use the WebSocket API.

## RPC HTTP Endpoint

# RPC Endpoints

**Testnet**
* `https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc`

**Local Development**
* `http://localhost:9900`
* `http://192.168.1.88:9900`

## Request Formatting

To make a JSON-RPC request, send an HTTP POST request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header. The JSON request data should contain 4 fields:

* `jsonrpc: <string>` - set to `"2.0"`
* `id: <string | number | null>` - a unique identifier for the request, generated by the client
* `method: <string>` - a string containing the method to be invoked
* `params: <array>` - a JSON array of ordered parameter values

Example using curl:

```bash
curl https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getPrice",
  "params": [
    "0x0003665949c883f9e0f6f002eac32e00bd59dfe6c34e92a91c37d6a8322d6489"
  ]
}
'
```

The response output will be a JSON object with the following fields:
* `jsonrpc: <string>` - matching the request specification
* `id: <number>` - matching the request identifier
* `result: <array|number|object|string>` - requested data or success confirmation

Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects as the data for a single POST.

## Example Request

The timestamp parameter can be included as the last element in the `params` array:

```bash
curl https://api.soon.network -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getPrice",
  "params": [
    "0x0003665949c883f9e0f6f002eac32e00bd59dfe6c34e92a91c37d6a8322d6489",
    {
      "timestamp": 1734670442
    }
  ]
}
'
```

## Definitions

* **Hash**: A SHA-256 hash of a chunk of data
* **Feed ID**: A unique identifier for a specific price feed
* **Signature**: An ECDSA signature of the report data that can be used for verification
* **Report**: A data structure containing price information and metadata for a specific feed

## Health Check

A `GET /health` at the RPC HTTP Endpoint provides a health-check mechanism for use by load balancers or other network infrastructure. This request will return a HTTP 200 OK response with a body of "ok", "behind" or "unknown":

* `ok`: The node is synchronized and processing requests normally
* `behind { distance }`: The node is behind by `distance` blocks from the latest network state
* `unknown`: The node is unable to determine its synchronization status

The health check endpoint can be accessed via:

```bash
curl https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc/health
```

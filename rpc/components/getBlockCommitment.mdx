#### Response Example
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "commitment": [
      100000000,
      200000000,
      300000000,
      400000000
    ],
    "totalStake": 500000000
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

#### Result
The result will be a JSON object containing:
* `commitment` - Commitment of the block, which can be:
  * `<null>` - Unknown block
  * `<array>` - An array of u64 integers representing the cluster stake in lamports that has voted on the block at each depth from 0 to `MAX_LOCKOUT_HISTORY` + 1
* `totalStake` - Total active stake in lamports for the current epoch

#### Notes
- The commitment array shows the cumulative stake that has voted on the block at different depths
- Each element represents the total stake (in lamports) that has confirmed the block at that specific depth
- The total stake provides context about the network's current staking distribution
